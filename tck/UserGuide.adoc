= Eclipse™ Sparkplug™ Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK) User Guide

== Introduction

This is the user guide for the Eclipse™ Sparkplug™ Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK).

=== Software Requirements

A HiveMQ instance is needed as the MQTT broker. The https://www.hivemq.com/developers/community/[HiveMQ Community edition]
is open source and freely available. Download the complete package, including the hivemq-allow-all-extension.

https://nodejs.org/en/[Node.js] and https://yarnpkg.com/[yarn] are needed to run the TCK Web Console
which controls the running of the tests.

=== Installation and Configuration

==== HiveMQ Broker

Install the HiveMQ broker following the instructions provided with it.

Copy the extension distribution file (tck/build/hivemq-extension/sparkplug-tck-3.0.1-SNAPSHOT.zip)
to the HiveMQ extension folder (extensions), and unzip the file there. 
The target folder should now have the following content.

----
|-| extensions/
  |-| sparkplug-tck/
    |--  hivemq-extension.xml
    |--  sparkplug-tck-3.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

Now, on starting the HiveMQ broker, this message should be seen:

----
Extension "Eclipse™ Sparkplug™ TCK" version 3.0.1-SNAPSHOT started successfully.
----

Add a websocket listener to the HiveMQ broker by updating the config.xml file.
(Example files for configuration config.xml and logging logback.xml can be found
in the hivemq-configuration folder).

----
<hivemq>
  <listeners>
    <tcp-listener>
      <port>1883</port>
      <bind-address>0.0.0.0</bind-address>
    </tcp-listener>
	<websocket-listener>
      <port>8000</port>
      <bind-address>0.0.0.0</bind-address>
      <path>/mqtt</path>
      <name>my-websocket-listener</name>
      <subprotocols>
        <subprotocol>mqttv3.1</subprotocol>
        <subprotocol>mqtt</subprotocol>
      </subprotocols>
      <allow-extensions>true</allow-extensions>
    </websocket-listener>
  </listeners>
  <anonymous-usage-statistics>
    <enabled>true</enabled>
  </anonymous-usage-statistics>
</hivemq>
----

As a result of these changes you should see these messages on startup showing
that both TCP and WebSocket listeners have been started:

----
Starting TCP listener on address 0.0.0.0 and port 1883
Starting Websocket listener on address 0.0.0.0 and port 8000
Started TCP Listener on address 0.0.0.0 and on port 1883
Started Websocket Listener on address 0.0.0.0 and on port 8000
----

Now we're ready to run the TCK web console.

==== TCK WebConsole

In the tck/webconsole folder first we have to install the dependencies:

`yarn install`

If you get an error message like this:

`The engine “node” is incompatible with this module. Expected version “>=10". Got “8.9.4”`

then the command

`yarn install --ignore-engines`

might help. Next build with

`yarn build`

then start the console back end with 

`yarn start`.

By default the console listens on localhost:3000, so open a Web Browser to that location.

The host and port on which the TCK web console listens can be changed by adding 
a server section to the https://nuxtjs.org/docs/features/configuration/#edit-host-and-port[nuxt.config.js] 
file in the web console directory. Here is an example which changes the host to 0.0.0.0 and the port to 4500.

----
export default {
 ...
  server: {
     host: 0,       // defaults to localhost
     port: 4500     // if you wanted to change the port too
  }
  ...
}
----


=== How to Run the Tests

The Web Console contain some instructions on how to run each test.

Firstly, you need to connect the console to the HiveMQ broker. 

1. Make sure the HiveMQ broker is running
2. Select the MQTT Configuration tab
3. Press "Set Default Values"
4. Press "Connect"

Now the console should be showing that it is connected to the broker.

There are three conformance profiles:

1. Sparkplug Host Applications
2. Sparkplug Edge Nodes
3. MQTT Brokers - Sparkplug compliant and aware

To run a specific test:

1. Select the Host Application profile
2. Add the Sparkplug Host Application ID to use (this is always needed)
3. Now select the profile you want to use
4. For the Edge Node profile, fill in the Group and Edge Node ID fields
5. Select the test you want to run
6. Follow the instructions provided

If any test does not finish automatically, you can press the "Stop Test" button 
to stop it and report on the results so far. 
The "Reset Test" button will clear the results for that test.

The results are recorded in a file which is stored in the HiveMQ bin folder.
Its default name is SparkplugTCKResults.log.

To get a summary report from that log, run report.py:

`python3 report.py ~/bin/hivemq-ce-2022.1/bin/SparkplugTCKResults.log`

Which will be written to summary.html. The log file will contain all the 
results from all the tests that have been run. Any failing results will be
recorded and reported on. Once your implementations are passing all the tests,
you will need to delete this log before running a clean set of tests so that
previous failing runs are not included.

Some groups of assertions are optional:

- Broker profile: Sparkplug Aware
- Host profile: message reordering
- Edge profile: aliases, datasets, properties and templates

If any tests are run in these optional groups, all the assertions in the group must 
be tested and passed.
