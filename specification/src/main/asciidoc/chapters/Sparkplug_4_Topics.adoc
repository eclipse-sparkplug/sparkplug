== Topics and Messages

To get a working Message Oriented Middleware based SCADA system using MQTT, the first thing that
must be defined is a topic namespace to work within. The beauty of MQTT is the fact that you can
just come up with an arbitrary topic like “Portland/Temperature”, connect to an MQTT Server, and
start publishing the temperature value. For this data to be useful to other MQTT Client applications
that want to consume the temperature values, the Topic Namespace needs to be understood by everyone
participating in the data exchange.

Every MQTT message published typically consists of a *_topic_* and *_payload_* components. These
components are the overhead of an MQTT message as measured in bytes on the wire. The Eclipse
Sparkplug Specification is designed to keep these components meaningful and easy to understand, but
not to get so verbose as to negatively impact bandwidth/time sensitive data exchange.

[[topics_sparkplug_topic_namespace_elements]]
=== Topic Namespace Elements

[tck-testable tck-id-topic-structure]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-topic-structure] All MQTT clients
using the Sparkplug specification MUST use the following topic namespace structure:*#

  namespace/group_id/message_type/edge_node_id/[device_id]

[[topics_namespace_element]]
==== namespace Element

The namespace element of the topic namespace is the root element that will define both the
structure of the remaining namespace elements as well as the encoding used for the associated
payload data. The Sparkplug specification defines two (2) namespaces. One is for Sparkplug payload
definition A (now deprecated), and the second is for the Sparkplug payload definition B.

[tck-testable tck-id-topic-structure-namespace-a]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-topic-structure-namespace-a] For
the Sparkplug B version of the payload definition, the UTF-8 string constant for the namespace
element MUST be:*#

  spBv1.0

Note that for the remainder of this document, the version of the Sparkplug Payload definition does
not affect the topic namespace or session state management as they will remain the same. There are
separate definitions in this document for the encoding used for both the A and B versions of
Sparkplug MQTT message payloads.

[[topics_group_id_element]]
==== group_id Element

The Group ID element of the topic namespace provides for a logical grouping of Sparkplug Edge
Nodes into the MQTT Server and back out to the consuming Sparkplug Host Applications.

[tck-testable tck-id-topic-structure-namespace-valid-group-id]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-topic-structure-namespace-valid-group-id] The
format of the Group ID MUST be a valid UTF-8 string with the exception of the reserved characters of
+ (plus), / (forward slash), and # (number sign).*#

In most use cases to minimize bandwidth, the Group ID should be descriptive but as small as
possible. Examples of where the [group_id] might be used include Oil/Gas applications where
Sparkplug Edge Nodes on a physical pipeline segment all have the same [group_id]. Plant floor
applications may group Sparkplug Edge Nodes based on logical cell or manufacturing line
requirements.

[[topics_message_type_element]]
==== message_type Element

The message_type element of the topic namespace provides an indication as to how to handle the
MQTT payload of the message. Note that the actual encoding of the payload will vary depending on the
version of the Sparkplug implementation as indicated by the namespace element.

The following message_type elements are defined for the Sparkplug topic namespace:

* *NMETA* - Metadata definition for Sparkplug Edge Nodes
* *NBIRTH* – Birth certificate for Sparkplug Edge Nodes
* *NDATA* – Edge Node data message
* *NDEATH* – Death certificate for Sparkplug Edge Nodes
* *NREBIRTH* - Edge Node Rebirth response sent from Sparkplug Edge Nodes

* *DMETA* - Metadata definition for Sparkplug Devices
* *DBIRTH* – Birth certificate for Devices
* *DDATA* – Device data message
* *DDEATH* – Death certificate for Devices
* *DREBIRTH* - Device Rebirth response sent from Sparkplug Edge Nodes

* *NCMD* – Edge Node command message
* *DCMD* – Device command message
* *STATE* – Sparkplug Host Application state message
* *REBIRTH* - Rebirth request for Sparkplug Edge Nodes sent by Host Applications

The specification for each of these _message_type_ elements are detailed later in this document.

[[topics_edge_node_id_element]]
==== edge_node_id Element

The edge_node_id element of the Sparkplug topic namespace uniquely identifies the Sparkplug Edge
Node within the infrastructure.

[tck-testable tck-id-topic-structure-namespace-unique-edge-node-descriptor]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-topic-structure-namespace-unique-edge-node-descriptor] The
group_id combined with the _edge_node_id_ element MUST be unique from any other
group_id/edge_node_id assigned in the MQTT infrastructure.*#

[tck-testable tck-id-topic-structure-namespace-valid-edge-node-id]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-topic-structure-namespace-valid-edge-node-id] The
format of the _edge_node_id_ MUST be a valid UTF-8 string with the exception of the reserved
characters of + (plus), / (forward slash), and # (number sign).*#

The topic element edge_node_id travels with every message published and should be as short as
 possible.

[[topics_device_id_element]]
==== device_id Element

The device_id element of the Sparkplug topic namespace identifies a device attached (physically
or logically) to the Sparkplug Edge Node. Note that the device_id is an optional element within
the topic namespace as some messages will be either originating or destined to the edge_node_id
and the device_id would not be required.

[tck-testable tck-id-topic-structure-namespace-valid-device-id]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-topic-structure-namespace-valid-device-id] The
format of the device_id MUST be a valid UTF-8 string except for the reserved characters of + (plus),
/ (forward slash), and # (number sign).*#

[tck-testable tck-id-topic-structure-namespace-unique-device-id]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-topic-structure-namespace-unique-device-id] The
device_id MUST be unique from other devices being reported on by the same Edge Node.*#

[tck-testable tck-id-topic-structure-namespace-duplicate-device-id-across-edge-node]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-topic-structure-namespace-duplicate-device-id-across-edge-node] The
device_id MAY be duplicated from Edge Node to other Edge Nodes.*#
The device_id element travels with every message published and should be as short as possible.

[tck-testable tck-id-topic-structure-namespace-device-id-associated-message-types]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-topic-structure-namespace-device-id-associated-message-types] The
device_id MUST be included with message_type elements DBIRTH, DDEATH, DDATA, and DCMD based topics.*#

[tck-testable tck-id-topic-structure-namespace-device-id-non-associated-message-types]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-topic-structure-namespace-device-id-non-associated-message-types] The
device_id MUST NOT be included with message_type elements NBIRTH, NDEATH, NDATA, NCMD, and STATE
based topics*#

[[topics_message_type_overview]]
=== Message Types and Contents

Sparkplug defines the topic namespace for set of MQTT messages that are used to manage connection
state as well as bidirectional metric information exchange that would apply to many typical
real-time SCADA/IIoT, monitoring, and data collection system use cases. The defined message types
are:

* *NMETA* - Metadata definition for Sparkplug Edge Nodes
* *NBIRTH* – Birth certificate for Sparkplug Edge Nodes
* *NDATA* – Edge Node data message
* *NDEATH* – Death certificate for Sparkplug Edge Nodes
* *NREBIRTH* - Edge Node Rebirth response sent from Sparkplug Edge Nodes

* *DMETA* - Metadata definition for Sparkplug Devices
* *DBIRTH* – Birth certificate for Devices
* *DDATA* – Device data message
* *DDEATH* – Death certificate for Devices
* *DREBIRTH* - Device Rebirth response sent from Sparkplug Edge Nodes

* *NCMD* – Edge Node command message
* *DCMD* – Device command message
* *STATE* – Sparkplug Host Application state message
* *REBIRTH* - Rebirth request for Sparkplug Edge Nodes sent by Host Applications

Using these defined messages Host Applications can:

* Discover all metadata and monitor state of all Edge Nodes and Devices connected to the MQTT
infrastructure.
* Discover all metrics which include all diagnostics, properties, metadata, and current state
values.
* Issue write/command messages to any Edge Node or Device metric.

This section defines the payload contents and how each of the associated message types can be used.

[[topics_edge_node]]
==== Edge Node
[upperalpha, start=1]

[[birth_message_nbirth]]
===== Birth Message (NBIRTH)

[[topics_birth_message_nbirth]]
====== Topic (NBIRTH)

* [tck-testable tck-id-topics-nbirth-topic]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-topics-nbirth-topic] The
Birth Certificate topic for a Sparkplug Edge Node MUST be of the form
'namespace/group_id/NBIRTH/edge_node_id' where the namespace is replaced with the specific namespace
for this version of Sparkplug and the group_id and edge_node_id are replaced with the Group and Edge
Node ID for this specific Edge Node.*#

[[payloads_desc_nbirth]]
====== Payload (NBIRTH)

The Sparkplug Edge Node Birth Certificate payload contains everything required to build out a data
structure for all metrics for this Edge Node. At the time any Host Application receives an NBIRTH,
the 'online' state of this Edge Node should be set to 'true' along with the associated 'online' date
and time parameter. Note that the Edge Node Birth Certificate ONLY indicates the Edge Node itself
is online and in an MQTT Session, but any devices that have previously published a DBIRTH will still
have STALE metric quality until the Host Application receives the new DBIRTH messages associated
with the new Sparkplug session..

The NBIRTH message requires the following payload components.

* [tck-testable tck-id-topics-nbirth-mqtt]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-topics-nbirth-mqtt] NBIRTH
messages MUST be published with MQTT QoS equal to 0 and retain equal to false.*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-topics-nbirth-seq-num]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-topics-nbirth-seq-num] The
NBIRTH MUST include a sequence number in the payload and it MUST have a value of 0.*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-topics-nbirth-timestamp]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-topics-nbirth-timestamp] The
NBIRTH MUST include a timestamp denoting the date and time the message was sent from the Edge Node.*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-topics-nbirth-metric-reqs]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-topics-nbirth-metric-reqs] The
NBIRTH MUST include every metric the Edge Node will ever report on.*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-topics-nbirth-metrics]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-topics-nbirth-metrics] At
a minimum each metric MUST include the metric name, datatype, and current value.*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-topics-nbirth-templates]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-topics-nbirth-templates] If
Template instances will be published by this Edge Node or any devices, all Template definitions MUST
be published in the NBIRTH.*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-topics-nbirth-bdseq-included]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-topics-nbirth-bdseq-included] A
bdSeq number as a metric MUST be included in the payload.*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-topics-nbirth-bdseq-matching]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-topics-nbirth-bdseq-matching] This
MUST match the bdSeq number provided in the MQTT CONNECT packet’s Will Message payload.*#
** This allows Host Applications to correlate NBIRTHs to NDEATHs.
* [tck-testable tck-id-topics-nbirth-bdseq-increment]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-topics-nbirth-bdseq-increment] The
bdSeq number MUST start at zero and increment by one on every new MQTT CONNECT packet.*#

The NBIRTH message can also include additional Node Control payload components. These are used by a
Sparkplug Host Application to control aspects of the Edge Node. The following are examples of Node
Control metrics.

* Metric name: ‘Node Control/Reboot’
** Used by Host Application(s) to reboot an Edge Node.
* Metric name: ‘Node Control/Next Server’
** Used by Host Application(s) to request an Edge Node to walk to the next MQTT Server in its
list in multi-MQTT Server environments.
* Metric name: ‘Node Control/Scan Rate’
** Used by Host Application(s) to modify a poll rate on an Edge Node.

The NBIRTH message can also include optional ‘Properties’ of an Edge Node. The following are
examples of Property metrics.

* Metric name: ‘Properties/Hardware Make’
** Used to transmit the hardware manufacturer of the Edge Node
* Metric name: ‘Properties/Hardware Model’
** Used to transmit the hardware model of the Edge Node
* Metric name: ‘Properties/OS’
** Used to transmit the operating system of the Edge Node
* Metric name: ‘Properties/OS Version’
** Used to transmit the OS version of the Edge Node

[[data_message_ndata]]
===== Data Message (NDATA)

Once an Sparkplug Edge Node is online with a proper NBIRTH it is in a mode of quiescent Report by
Exception (RBE) or time based reporting of metric information that changes. This enables the
advantages of the native Continuous Session Awareness of MQTT to monitor the state of all connected
Sparkplug Edge Nodes and to rely on Report by Exception (RBE) messages for metric state changes over
the MQTT session connection. Time based reporting is not explicitly disallowed by the Sparkplug
Specification but it is discouraged. Due to the session awareness provided by MQTT and Sparkplug it
is not necessary to send the same data again on a periodic basis.

[[topics_data_message_ndata]]
====== Topic (NDATA)

* [tck-testable tck-id-topics-ndata-topic]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-topics-ndata-topic] The
Edge Node data topic for a Sparkplug Edge Node MUST be of the form
'namespace/group_id/NDATA/edge_node_id' where the namespace is replaced with the specific namespace
for this version of Sparkplug and the group_id and edge_node_id are replaced with the Group and Edge
Node ID for this specific Edge Node.*#

The payload of NDATA messages will contain any RBE or time based metric Edge Node values that need
to be reported to any subscribing MQTT clients.

[[payloads_desc_ndata]]
====== Payload (NDATA)

The NDATA message requires the following payload components.

* [tck-testable tck-id-topics-ndata-mqtt]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-topics-ndata-mqtt] NDATA
messages MUST be published with MQTT QoS equal to 0 and retain equal to false.*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-topics-ndata-seq-num]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-topics-ndata-seq-num] The
NDATA MUST include a sequence number in the payload and it MUST have a value of one greater than the
previous MQTT message from the Edge Node contained unless the previous MQTT message contained a
value of 255. In this case the sequence number MUST be 0.*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-topics-ndata-timestamp]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-topics-ndata-timestamp] The
NDATA MUST include a timestamp denoting the date and time the message was sent from the Edge Node.*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-topics-ndata-payload]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-topics-ndata-payload] The
NDATA MUST include the Edge Node’s metrics that have changed since the last NBIRTH or NDATA
message.*#

[[death_message_ndeath]]
===== Death Message (NDEATH)

The Death Certificate topic and payload described here are not “published” as an MQTT message by a
client, but provided as parameters within the MQTT CONNECT control packet when this Sparkplug Edge
Node first establishes the MQTT Client session.

Immediately upon reception of an Edge Node Death Certificate (NDEATH message) with a bdSeq number
that matches the preceding bdSeq number in the NBIRTH, any Host Application subscribed to this Edge
Node should set the data quality of all metrics to STALE and should note the timestamp when the
NDEATH message was received.

[[topics_death_message_ndeath]]
====== Topic (NDEATH)

* [tck-testable tck-id-topics-ndeath-topic]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-topics-ndeath-topic] The
Edge Node Death Certificate topic for a Sparkplug Edge Node MUST be of the form
'namespace/group_id/NDEATH/edge_node_id' where the namespace is replaced with the specific namespace
for this version of Sparkplug and the group_id and edge_node_id are replaced with the Group and Edge
Node ID for this specific Edge Node.*#
  
[[payloads_desc_ndeath]]
====== Payload (NDEATH)

* [tck-testable tck-id-topics-ndeath-payload]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-topics-ndeath-payload] The
NDEATH message contains a very simple payload that MUST only include a single metric, the bdSeq
number, so that the NDEATH event can be associated with the NBIRTH.*#
Since this is typically published by the MQTT Server on behalf of the Edge Node, information about
the current state of the Edge Node and its devices is not and cannot be known. As a result,
[tck-testable tck-id-topics-ndeath-seq]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-topics-ndeath-seq] The NDEATH
message MUST NOT include a sequence number.*#

The MQTT payload typically associated with this topic can include a Birth/Death sequence number used
to track and synchronize Birth and Death sequences across the MQTT infrastructure. Since this
payload will be defined in advance, and held in the MQTT server and only delivered on the
termination of an MQTT session, not a lot of additional diagnostic information can be pre-populated
into the payload.

[[command_ncmd]]
===== Command (NCMD)

[[topics_command_ncmd]]
====== Topic (NCMD)

The NCMD command topic provides the topic namespace used to send commands to any connected Edge
Nodes. This means sending an updated metric value to an associated metric included in the NBIRTH
metric list.

* [tck-testable tck-id-topics-ncmd-topic]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-topics-ncmd-topic] The
Edge Node command topic for a Sparkplug Edge Node MUST be of the form
'namespace/group_id/NCMD/edge_node_id' where the namespace is replaced with the specific namespace
for this version of Sparkplug and the group_id and edge_node_id are replaced with the Group and Edge
Node ID for this specific Edge Node.*#
  
[[payloads_desc_ncmd]]
====== Payload (NCMD)

The NCMD message requires the following payload components.

* [tck-testable tck-id-topics-ncmd-mqtt]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-topics-ncmd-mqtt] NCMD messages
MUST be published with MQTT QoS equal to 0 and retain equal to false.*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-topics-ncmd-timestamp]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-topics-ncmd-timestamp] The
NCMD MUST include a timestamp denoting the date and time the message was sent from the Host
Application’s MQTT client.*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-topics-ncmd-payload]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-topics-ncmd-payload] The
NCMD MUST include the metrics that need to be written to on the Edge Node.*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-topics-ncmd-payload-source]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-topics-ncmd-payload-source] The
NCMD MUST have the 'source' field set in the payload and it MUST have a string value representing
the Host ID of the Sparkplug Host Application that sent the NCMD message.*#

[[topics_device_sensor]]  
==== Device/Sensor
[upperalpha, start=1]

[[birth_message_dbirth]]
===== Birth Message (DBIRTH)

The Sparkplug Edge Node is responsible for the management of all attached physical and/or logical
devices. Once the Edge Node has published its NBIRTH, any Sparkplug Host Application ensures that
the metric structure has the Edge Node in an 'online' state. But each physical and/or logical device
connected to this node will still need to provide this DBIRTH before Host Applications
create/update the metric structure (if this is the first time this device has been seen) and set any
associated metrics in the application to a “*GOOD*” state.

The DBIRTH payload contains everything required to build out a data structure for all metrics for
this device. The 'online' state of this device should be set to TRUE along with the associated
'online' date and time this message was received.

[[topics_birth_message_dbirth]]
====== Topic (DBIRTH)

* [tck-testable tck-id-topics-dbirth-topic]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-topics-dbirth-topic] The
Device Birth topic for a Sparkplug Device MUST be of the form
'namespace/group_id/DBIRTH/edge_node_id/device_id' where the namespace is replaced with the specific
namespace for this version of Sparkplug and the group_id, edge_node_id, and device_id are replaced
with the Group, Edge Node, and Device ID for this specific Device.*#

[[payloads_desc_dbirth]]
====== Payload (DBIRTH)

The DBIRTH message requires the following payload components.

* [tck-testable tck-id-topics-dbirth-mqtt]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-topics-dbirth-mqtt] DBIRTH
messages MUST be published with MQTT QoS equal to 0 and retain equal to false.*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-topics-dbirth-seq]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-topics-dbirth-seq] The DBIRTH
MUST include a sequence number in the payload and it MUST have a value of one greater than the
previous MQTT message from the Edge Node contained unless the previous MQTT message contained a
value of 255. In this case the sequence number MUST be 0.*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-topics-dbirth-timestamp]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-topics-dbirth-timestamp] The
DBIRTH MUST include a timestamp denoting the date and time the message was sent from the Edge Node.*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-topics-dbirth-metric-reqs]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-topics-dbirth-metric-reqs] The
DBIRTH MUST include every metric the Edge Node will ever report on.*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-topics-dbirth-metrics]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-topics-dbirth-metrics] At
a minimum each metric MUST include the metric name, metric datatype, and current value.*#

The DBIRTH message can also include optional ‘Device Control’ payload components. These are used by
a Host Application to control aspects of a device. The following are examples of Device Control
metrics.

* Metric name: ‘Device Control/Reboot’
** Used by Host Application(s) to reboot a device.
* Metric name: ‘Device Control/Scan rate’
** Used by Host Application(s) to modify a poll rate on a device.

The DBIRTH message can also include optional ‘Properties’ of a device. The following are examples of 
Property metrics.

* Metric name: ‘Properties/Hardware Make’
** Used to transmit the hardware manufacturer of the device
* Metric name: ‘Properties/Hardware Model’
** Used to transmit the hardware model of the device
* Metric name: ‘Properties/FW’
** Used to transmit the firmware version of the device

[[data_message_ddata]]
===== Data Message (DDATA)

Once a Sparkplug Edge Node and associated Devices are all online with proper Birth Certificates it
is in a mode of quiescent Report by Exception (RBE) reporting of any metric that changes. This takes
advantage of the native Continuous Session Awareness of MQTT to monitor the state of all connected
devices and can rely on Report by Exception (RBE) messages for any metric value change over the MQTT
session connection. Again, time based reporting can be used instead of RBE but is discouraged and
typically unnecessary.

[[topics_data_message_ddata]]
====== Topic (DDATA)

* [tck-testable tck-id-topics-ddata-topic]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-topics-ddata-topic] The
Device command topic for a Sparkplug Device MUST be of the form
'namespace/group_id/DDATA/edge_node_id/device_id' where the namespace is replaced with the specific
namespace for this version of Sparkplug and the group_id, edge_node_id, and device_id are replaced
with the Group, Edge Node, and Device ID for this specific Device.*#

The payload of DDATA messages can contain one or more metric values that need to be reported.

[[payloads_desc_ddata]]
====== Payload (DDATA)

The DDATA message requires the following payload components.

* [tck-testable tck-id-topics-ddata-mqtt]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-topics-ddata-mqtt] DDATA
messages MUST be published with MQTT QoS equal to 0 and retain equal to false.*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-topics-ddata-seq-num]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-topics-ddata-seq-num] The
DDATA MUST include a sequence number in the payload and it MUST have a value of one greater than the
previous MQTT message from the Edge Node contained unless the previous MQTT message contained a
value of 255. In this case the sequence number MUST be 0.*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-topics-ddata-timestamp]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-topics-ddata-timestamp] The
DDATA MUST include a timestamp denoting the date and time the message was sent from the Edge Node.*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-topics-ddata-payload]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-topics-ddata-payload] The
DDATA MUST include the Device’s metrics that have changed since the last DBIRTH or DDATA message.*#

[[death_message_ddeath]]
===== Death Message (DDEATH)

It is the responsibility of the Sparkplug Edge Node to indicate the real-time state of either
physical legacy device using poll/response protocols and/or local logical devices. If the device
becomes unavailable for any reason (no response, CRC error, etc.) it is the responsibility of the
Edge Node to publish a DDEATH on behalf of the end device.

Immediately upon reception of a DDEATH, any Host Application subscribed to this device should set
the data quality of all metrics for the Device to STALE and should note the timestamp when the
DDEATH message was received.

[[topics_death_message_ddeath]]
====== Topic (DDEATH)

* [tck-testable tck-id-topics-ddeath-topic]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-topics-ddeath-topic] The
Device Death Certificate topic for a Sparkplug Device MUST be of the form
'namespace/group_id/DDEATH/edge_node_id/device_id' where the namespace is replaced with the specific
namespace for this version of Sparkplug and the group_id, edge_node_id, and device_id are replaced
with the Group, Edge Node, and Device ID for this specific Device.*#
  
[[payloads_desc_ddeath]]
====== Payload (DDEATH)

The DDEATH message requires the following payload components.

* [tck-testable tck-id-topics-ddeath-mqtt]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-topics-ddeath-mqtt] DDEATH
messages MUST be published with MQTT QoS equal to 0 and retain equal to false.*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-topics-ddeath-seq-num]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-topics-ddeath-seq-num] The
DDEATH MUST include a sequence number in the payload and it MUST have a value of one greater than
the previous MQTT message from the Edge Node contained unless the previous MQTT message contained a
value of 255. In this case the sequence number MUST be 0.*#

[[command_dcmd]]
===== Command (DCMD)

The DCMD topic provides the topic namespace used to publish metrics to any connected device. This
means sending a new metric value to an associated metric included in the DBIRTH metric list.

[[topics_command_dcmd]]
====== Topic DCMD)

* [tck-testable tck-id-topics-dcmd-topic]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-topics-dcmd-topic] The
Device command topic for a Sparkplug Device MUST be of the form
'namespace/group_id/DCMD/edge_node_id/device_id' where the namespace is replaced with the specific
namespace for this version of Sparkplug and the group_id, edge_node_id, and device_id are replaced
with the Group, Edge Node, and Device ID for this specific Device.*#
  
[[payloads_desc_dcmd]]
====== Payload (DCMD)

The DCMD message requires the following payload components.

* [tck-testable tck-id-topics-dcmd-mqtt]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-topics-dcmd-mqtt] DCMD messages
MUST be published with MQTT QoS equal to 0 and retain equal to false.*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-topics-dcmd-timestamp]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-topics-dcmd-timestamp] The

===== Birth Certificate Message (STATE)

[tck-testable tck-id-host-topic-phid-birth-message]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-host-topic-phid-birth-message] The
first MQTT message a Host Application MUST publish is a Birth Certificate.*#
The Host Application Death Certificate is registered within the establishment of the MQTT session
and is published as a part of the native MQTT transport if the MQTT session terminates for any
reason.

The Birth Certificate that is defined here is an MQTT application level message published by the

[[topics_birth_message_state]]
====== Birth Certificate Topic (STATE)

The topic used for the Host Birth Certificate is identical to the topic used for the Death
Certificate.
[tck-testable tck-id-host-topic-phid-birth-topic]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-host-topic-phid-birth-topic] The
Sparkplug Host Application Birth topic MUST be of the form spBv1.0/STATE/sparkplug_host_id where the
sparkplug_host_id must be replaced with the specific Spakrplug Host ID of this Sparkplug Host
Application.*#

* [tck-testable tck-id-host-topic-phid-birth-sub-required]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-host-topic-phid-birth-sub-required] The
Sparkplug Host Application MUST subscribe to its own spBv1.0/STATE/sparkplug_host_id and the
appropriate spBv1.0 topic(s) immediately after successfully connecting to the MQTT Server.*#
** An 'appropriate' spBv1.0 topic could simply be 'spBv1.0/#'. However, it may also make sense for
a Host Application to subscribe only to a specific Sparkplug Group. For example subscribing to
spBv1.0/Group1/# is also valid. A Host Application could even issue a subscription to subscribe to
only a single Sparkplug Edge Node using this: spBv1.0/Group1/+/EdgeNode1/#. A Sparkplug Host
Application could subscribe to a combination of specific Sparkplug Groups and/or Edge Nodes as well.
* [tck-testable tck-id-host-topic-phid-birth-required]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-host-topic-phid-birth-required] The
Sparkplug Host Application MUST publish a Sparkplug Host Application BIRTH message to the MQTT
Server immediately after successfully subscribing its own spBv1.0/STATE/sparkplug_host_id topic.*#

[[payloads_desc_state_birth]]
====== Birth Certificate Payload (STATE)

* [tck-testable tck-id-host-topic-phid-birth-payload]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-host-topic-phid-birth-payload] The
Birth Certificate Payload MUST be JSON UTF-8 data. It MUST include two key/value pairs where the
one key MUST be 'online' and it's value is a boolean 'true'. The other key MUST be 'timestamp' and
the value MUST be a numeric value representing the current UTC time in milliseconds since Epoch.*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-host-topic-phid-birth-payload-timestamp]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-host-topic-phid-birth-payload-timestamp] The
timestamp metric value MUST be the same timestamp value set in the immediately prior MQTT CONNECT
packet's Will Message payload.*#

Sparkplug B payloads are not used for encoding in this payload. This allows Host Applications to
work across Sparkplug payload types.

[[death_message_state]]
===== Death Certificate Message (STATE)

When the Sparkplug Host Application MQTT client establishes an MQTT session to the MQTT Server(s),
the Death Certificate will be part of the Will Topic and Will Payload registered in the MQTT CONNECT
packet.

* [tck-testable tck-id-host-topic-phid-death-payload-timestamp-disconnect-clean]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-host-topic-phid-death-payload-disconnect-clean] If
a Host Application is disconnecting cleanly using MQTT DISCONNECT packet, the Host Application MUST
publish a Death Certificate payload before sending the MQTT DISCONNECT packet with the timestamp set
to the current UTC time the disconnect is occurring.*#

MUST publish a Death Certificate payload before terminating the MQTT connection with the timestamp
set to the current UTC time the disconnect is occurring.*#
