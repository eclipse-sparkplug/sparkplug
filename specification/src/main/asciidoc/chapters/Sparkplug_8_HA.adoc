[[high_availability]]
== High Availability

Sparkplug™ based infrastructures are often used in mission-critical environments. Planning for high
availability is a key requirement for many Sparkplug users. This section discusses non-normative
approaches to achieving high availability.

[[high_availability_for_mqtt_servers]]
=== High Availability for MQTT Servers

A core component of MQTT based infrastructures is the MQTT Server. It is the central data broker and
together with the Primary Host Application a potential single point of failure. All components are
connected to the MQTT Server all the time and a failure of the MQTT Server will cause unavailability
of the whole infrastructure.

There are two options for MQTT Server High Availability in Sparkplug:

. MQTT Server HA Clustering
. Multiple isolated MQTT Servers

Both approaches have been deployed successfully in mission critical environments and depending on
the MQTT Server software used, not all options might be available.

[[high_availability_ha_clusters]]
==== MQTT Server HA Clustering (non-normative)

A single MQTT Server is a single point of failure in a Sparkplug infrastructure, which means a
failure of the Server will cause a downtime for all other components.

MQTT Servers that support clustering allow to install multiple MQTT Servers and connect them to a
cluster. This means all relevant MQTT data is synchronized between these servers. If one or multiple
MQTT Server fail, all data is still present at the other MQTT Servers.

The main advantage of MQTT Server clusters is operations simplicity. Sparkplug components don't need
to distribute state themselves between MQTT Servers (which is required for
<<high_availability_multiple_mqtt_server_topology,Multiple MQTT Server Topologies>>). From the
perspective of an MQTT Edge node, MQTT enabled Device, Primary Host Application, or Secondary Host
Application, any of the MQTT Servers can be used and devices are not required to be connected to the
same MQTT Server. A MQTT cluster provides the illusion to MQTT clients that there is only one MQTT
server while providing High Availability.

There are two options available for deploying HA MQTT Server clusters:

. High Availability Cluster without Load Balancer
. High Availability Cluster with Load Balancer


[[high_availability_cluster]]
==== High Availability Cluster

In traditional clustered MQTT Server settings, each MQTT Server is reachable by all MQTT Edge Nodes,
Primary Host Applications, Secondary Host Applications and MQTT enabled Devices. Each component can
connect directly to any MQTT Server. A message sent to any MQTT Server will be distributed to all
available MQTT Servers in the cluster (which will distribute the message to all subscribing
Sparkplug components).

If any MQTT Server would fail, the MQTT connection for components connected to the broker will break
and the component can connect to any other MQTT Server to resume operations.


[[high_availability_cluster_with_load_balancer]]
==== High Availability Cluster with Load Balancer

For dynamic environments where the IP addresses of the MQTT Servers might not be available
beforehand (like in cloud native deployment environments such as Kubernetes) or for cases where it's
not desired that all IP addresses (or DNS lookup names) are configured on the Sparkplug components,
a load balancer might be used.

image:extracted-media/media/image16.png[image,width=660,height=314]

Figure X – High Availability MQTT Server Cluster with Load Balancer

A load balancer acts as the single point of contact for Sparkplug components, so only a single IP
address or DNS name needs to be configured on the components. The load balancer will proxy the MQTT
connections of the components and route to one available MQTT Server. In case of a MQTT Server
failure, the component only needs to reconnect to the load balancer again.

The use of a specific load balancer depends on the MQTT Server used. Usually most load balancers
work with most Sparkplug compatible MQTT Servers on the market.


[[high_availability_multiple_mqtt_server_topology]]
=== Multiple Isolated MQTT Servers (non-normative)

A second approach to high availability is the use of several isolated MQTT Servers. This approach
works with all Sparkplug certified MQTT Servers and does not need cluster technology but requires
Primary Host Applications that support multiple isolated MQTT brokers. The
_Primary Host Application_ is responsible for managing state across the several MQTT brokers.

When multiple MQTT Servers are available there is the possibility of “stranding” and EoN node if the
Primary command/control of the _Primary Host Application_ loses network connectivity to one of the
MQTT Servers. In this instance the EoN node would stay properly connected to the MQTT Server
publishing information not knowing that _Primary Host Application_ was not able to receive the
messages. When using multiple MQTT Servers, the _Primary Host Application_ instance must be
configured to publish a STATE Birth Certificate and all EoN nodes need to subscribe to this STATE
message.

The _Primary Host Application_ will need to specify whether it is a “Primary” command/control
instance or not. If it is a primary instance then every time it establishes a new MQTT Session with
an MQTT Server, the STATE Birth Certificate defined in section above is the first message that is
published after a successful MQTT Session is established.

EoN node devices in an infrastructure that provides multiple MQTT Servers can establish a session to
any one of the MQTT Servers. Upon establishing a session, the EoN node should issue a subscription
to the STATE message published by _Primary Host Application_. Since the STATE message is published
with the RETAIN message flag set, MQTT will guarantee that the last STATE message is always
available. The EoN node should examine the payload of this message to ensure that it is a value of
“ONLINE”. If the value is “OFFLINE”, this indicates the Primary Application has lost its MQTT
Session to this particular MQTT Server. This should cause the EoN node to terminate its session
with this MQTT Server and move to the next available MQTT Server that is available. This use of the
STATE message in this manner ensures that any loss of connectivity to an MQTT Server to the
_Primary Host Application_ does not result in EoN nodes being “stranded” on an MQTT server because
of network issues. The following message flow diagram outlines how the STATE message is used when
three (3) MQTT Servers are available in the infrastructure:

Figure 7 – Primary Application STATE flow diagram

[arabic]
. When an EoN node is configured with multiple available MQTT Servers in the infrastructure it
should issue a subscription to the _Primary Host Application_ STATE message. The EoN nodes are free
to establish an MQTT Session to any of the available servers over any available network at any time
and examine the current STATE value. If the STATE message payload is ‘OFFLINE’ then the EoN node
should disconnect and walk to the next available server.
. Upon startup, the configured Primary Application, the MQTT Session will be configured to register
the _Primary Host Application_ DEATH Certificate that indicates STATE is ‘OFFLINE’ with the message
RETAIN flag set to true. Then the _Primary Host Application_ BIRTH Certificate will be published
with a STATE payload of ‘ONLINE’.
. As the EoN node walks its available MQTT Server table, it will establish an MQTT Session with a
server that has a STATE message with a payload of ‘ONLINE’. The EoN node can stay connected to this
server if its MQTT Session stays intact and it does not receive the _Primary Host Application_ DEATH
Certificate.
. Having a subscription registered to the MQTT Server on the STATE topic will result in any change
to the current the _Primary Host Application_ STATE being received immediately. In this case, a
network disruption causes the _Primary Host Application_ MQTT Session to server #2 to be terminated.
This will cause the MQTT Server, on behalf of the now terminated the _Primary Host Application_ MQTT
Client to publish the DEATH certificate to anyone that is currently subscribed to it. Upon receipt
of the _Primary Host Application_ DEATH Certificate this EoN node will move to the next MQTT Server
in its table.
. The EoN node moved to the next available MQTT Server and since the current STATE on this server is
‘ONLINE’, it can stay connected.
. In the meantime, the network disruption between _Primary Host Application_ and MQTT Server #2 has
been corrected. The _Primary Host Application_ has a new MQTT Session established to server #2 with
an update Birth Certificate of ‘ONLINE’. Now MQTT Server #2 is ready to accept new EoN node session
requests.
