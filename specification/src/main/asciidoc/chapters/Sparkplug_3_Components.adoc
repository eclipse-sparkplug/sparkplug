== Sparkplug Architecture and Infrastructure Components

This section details the infrastructure components implemented.

Figure 1 - MQTT SCADA Infrastructure

[[components_mqtt_servers]]
=== MQTT Server(s)

MQTT enabled infrastructure requires that one or more MQTT Servers are present in the
infrastructure. The only requirement that the Sparkplug™ specification places on the selection of a
MQTT Server component in the architecture is it is required to be compliant with the MQTT v3.1.1 or
v5.0 specification and is sized to properly manage all MQTT message traffic.

One can implement the use (if required) of multiple MQTT servers for redundancy, high availability,
and scalability within any given infrastructure.

[[components_mqtt_edge_of_network_node]]
=== MQTT Edge of Network (EoN) Node (aka Edge Node)

In the context of this specification, an MQTT Edge of Network (EoN) Node is any MQTT v3.1.1 or v5.0
compliant MQTT Client application that manages an MQTT session and provides the physical and/or
logical gateway functions required to participate in the topic namespace and payload definitions
described in this document. The EoN node is responsible for any local protocol interface to existing
legacy devices (PLCs, RTUs, Flow Computers, Sensors, etc.) and/or any local discrete I/O, and/or any
logical internal process variables(PVs).

[[components_device_sensor]]
=== Device / Sensor 

The Device/Sensor represents any physical or logical device connected to the MQTT EoN node providing
any data, process variables or metrics.

[[components_mqtt_enabled_device]]
=== MQTT Enabled Device (Sparkplug)

This represents any device, sensor, or hardware that directly connects to MQTT infrastructure using
a compliant MQTT v3.1.1 or v5.0 connection with the payload and topic notation as outlined in this
Sparkplug  specification. Note that it will be represented as an EoN node in the Sparkplug topic
payload.

[[components_primary_host_application]]
=== Primary Host Application

A Primary Host Application is any MQTT client application that subscribes to MQTT EoN originated
messages.
[tck-testable tck-id-components-ph-state]#A Primary Host Application MUST also utilize the STATE
messages to denote whether it is online or offline at any given point in time.#
The Primary Host Application is often also referred to as the SCADA Host or IIoT Host. In typical
SCADA/IIoT infrastructure implementations, there will be only one *Primary* Host Application
responsible for the monitoring and control of a given group of MQTT EoN nodes. Sparkplug does
support the notion of multiple Primary Host Applications. This does not preclude any number of
additional MQTT Application Nodes participating in the infrastructure that are in either a pure
monitoring mode, or in the role of a hot standby should the Primary Host Application go offline.

[[components_host_application]]
=== Host Application 

An MQTT Application Node is any non-Primary Host Application MQTT client application that consumes
the real-time messages or any other data being published with proper permission and security.
