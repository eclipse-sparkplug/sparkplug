Figure 1 - MQTT SCADA Infrastructure

[[components_mqtt_servers]]
=== MQTT Server(s)

MQTT enabled infrastructure requires that one or more MQTT Servers are present in the infrastructure. The 
only requirement that the Sparkplug™ specification places on the selection of an MQTT Server component in the 
architecture is it is required to be compliant with the latest MQTT V3.1.1 specification and is sized to 
properly manage all MQTT message traffic.

One can implement the use (if required) of multiple MQTT servers for redundancy, high availability, and 
scalability within any given infrastructure.

[[components_mqtt_edge_of_network_node]]
=== MQTT Edge of Network (EoN) Node (aka Edge Node)

In the context of this specification, an MQTT Edge of Network (EoN) Node is any v3.1.1 compliant MQTT Client 
application that manages an MQTT Session and provides the physical and/or logical gateway functions required 
to participate in the Topic Namespace and Payload definitions described in this document. The EoN node is 
responsible for any local protocol interface to existing legacy devices (PLCs, RTUs, Flow Computers, Sensors, 
etc.) and/or any local discrete I/O, and/or any logical internal process variables(PVs).

[[components_device_sensor]]
=== Device / Sensor 

The Device/Sensor represents any physical or logical device connected to the MQTT EoN node providing any 
data, process variables or metrics.

[[components_mqtt_enabled_device]]
=== MQTT Enabled Device (Sparkplug)

This represents any device, sensor, or hardware that directly connects to MQTT infrastructure using a 
compliant MQTT 3.1.1 connection with the payload and topic notation as outlined in this Sparkplug 
specification. Note that it will be represented as an EoN node in the Sparkplug topic payload.

[[components_scada_iiot_host]]
=== SCADA / IIoT Host

The SCADA/IIoT Host Node is any MQTT Client application that subscribes to and publishes messages defined in 
this document. In typical SCADA/IIoT infrastructure implementations, there will be only one *Primary* 
SCADA/IIoT Host Node responsible for the monitoring and control of a given group of MQTT EoN nodes. 
Sparkplug does support the notion of multiple critical Host applications. This does not preclude any number 
of additional MQTT SCADA/IIoT Nodes participating in the infrastructure that are in either a pure monitoring 
mode, or in the role of a hot standby should the Primary MQTT SCADA/IIoT Host go offline.

[[components_mqtt_application_node]]
=== MQTT Application Node 

An MQTT Application Node is any non-primary MQTT SCADA/IIoT Client application that consumes the real-time 
messages or any other data being published with proper permission and security.
