== Introduction

[[introduction_rationale_and_use_case]]
=== Rationale and Use Case

Eclipse Sparkplug™ provides an open and freely available specification for how Edge of Network
Gateways (Sparkplug Edge Nodes) or native MQTT enabled end devices and MQTT Host Applications
communicate bi-directionally within an MQTT Infrastructure. This document details the structure and
implementation requirements for Sparkplug compliant MQTT Client implementations on both Edge Nodes
and Host Applications.

It is recognized that MQTT is used across a wide spectrum of application solution use-cases, and an
almost indefinable variation of network topologies. To that end the Sparkplug Specification strives
to accomplish the three following goals.

[[introduction_define_an_mqtt_topic_namespace]]
==== Define an MQTT Topic Namespace

As noted many times in this document one of the many attractive features of MQTT is that is does not
specify any required MQTT Topic Namespace within its implementation. This fact has meant that MQTT
has taken a dominant position across a wide spectrum of IoT solutions. The intent of the Sparkplug
Specification is to identify and document a Topic Namespace that is well thought out and optimized
for the SCADA/IIoT solution sector. In addition, Sparkplug defines a Topic Namespace in such away
that it provides semantics which allow for automatic discovery and bi-directional communication
between MQTT clients in a system.

[[introduction_define_mqtt_state_management]]
==== Define MQTT State Management

One of the unique aspects of MQTT is that it was originally designed for real time SCADA systems to
help reduce data latency over bandwidth limited and often unreliable network infrastructures. In
many implementations the full benefit of this “Continuous Session Awareness” is not well understood,
or not even implemented. The intent of the Sparkplug Specification is to take full advantage of
MQTT’s native Continuous Session Awareness capability as it applies to real time SCADA/IIoT
solutions.

[[introduction_define_the_mqtt_payload]]
==== Define the MQTT Payload

Just as the MQTT Specification does not dictate any particular Topic Namespace, it also does not
dictate any particular payload data encoding. The intent of the Sparkplug Specification is to define
payload encoding mechanisms that remain true to the original, lightweight, bandwidth efficient, low
latency features of MQTT while adding modern encoding schemes targeting the SCADA/IIoT solution
space.

Sparkplug has defined an approach where the Topic Namespace can aid in the determination of the
encoding scheme of any particular payload. Historically there have been two Sparkplug defined
encoding schemes. The first one was the 'Sparkplug A' and the second is 'Sparkplug B'. Each of
these uses a 'first topic token identifier' so Sparkplug Edge Nodes can declare the payload encoding
scheme they are using. These first topic tokens are:

----
spAv1.0
spBv1.0
----

Each token is divided up into three distinct components. These are:

* Sparkplug Identifier
** Always 'sp'
* Payload Encoding Scheme
** Currently 'A' or 'B' but there could be future versions
* Payload Encoding Scheme Version
** Currently v1.0 but denoted in the event that future versions are released

The original 'Sparkplug A' encoding scheme was based on the Eclipse Kura™ open source Google
Protocol Buffer definition. 'Sparkplug B' was released shortly after the release of Sparkplug A and
addressed a number of issues that were present in the A version of the payload encoding scheme. Due
to lack of adoption and the fact that 'Sparkplug B' was made available shortly after the release of
'A', the Sparkplug A definition has been omitted from this document and is no longer supported.

The 'Sparkplug B' encoding scheme was created with a richer data model developed with the feedback
of many system integrators and end user customers using MQTT. These additions included metric
timestamp support, complex datatype support, metadata, and other improvements.

[[introduction_background]]
==== Background

MQTT was originally designed as a message transport for real-time SCADA systems. The MQTT
Specification does not specify the Topic Namespace nor does it define the Payload representation
of the data being published and/or subscribed to. In addition to this, since the original use-case
for MQTT was targeting real-time SCADA, there are mechanisms defined to provide the state of an
MQTT session such that SCADA/Control Human-Machine Interface (HMI) application can monitor the
current state of any MQTT enabled device in the infrastructure. As with the Topic Namespace and
Payload the way state information is implemented and managed within the MQTT infrastructure is not
defined. All of this was intentional within the original MQTT Specification to provide maximum
flexibility across any solution sector that might choose to use MQTT infrastructures.

But at some point, for MQTT based solutions to be interoperable within a given market sector, the
Topic Namespace, Payload representation, and session state must be defined. The intent and purpose
of the Sparkplug Specification is to define an MQTT Topic Namespace, payload, and session state
management that can be applied generically to the overall IIoT market sector, but specifically meets
the requirements of real-time SCADA/Control HMI solutions. Meeting the operational requirements for
these systems will enable MQTT based infrastructures to provide more valuable real-time information
to Line of Business and MES solution requirements as well.

The purpose of the Sparkplug Specification is to remain true to the original notion of keeping the
Topic Namespace and message sizes to a minimum while still making the overall message transactions
and session state management between MQTT enabled devices and MQTT SCADA/IIoT applications simple,
efficient and easy to understand and implement.

[[introduction_terminology]]
=== Terminology

[[introduction_infrastructure_components]]
==== Infrastructure Components

This section details the infrastructure components implemented.

image:extracted-media/media/image5.png[image,width=660,height=314]
Figure 1 - MQTT SCADA Infrastructure

[[introduction_mqtt_servers]]
===== MQTT Server(s)

MQTT enabled infrastructure requires that one or more MQTT Servers are present in the
infrastructure. An MQTT Server must be compatible with the requirements outlined in the
link:#conformance[Conformance Section]. In addition, it must be sized to properly manage all MQTT
message traffic.

One can implement the use (if required) of multiple MQTT servers for redundancy, high availability,
and scalability within any given infrastructure.

[[introduction_sparkplug_group]]
===== Sparkplug Group

A 'Sparkplug Group' is a logical or physical group of Edge Nodes that makes sense in the context of
a distributed Sparkplug application. Groups can represent physical groups of Edge Nodes. For
example, a Sparkplug Group could represent a set of Edge Nodes at a particular location, facility,
or along a specific oil pipeline. Alternatively, a Sparkplug Group could represent group of similar
types of Edge Nodes. For example, it could represent a particular set of like make and models of
embedded gateways. The groups are meant to be defined by the system architects as appropriate for
their particular application.

[[introduction_sparkplug_edge_node]]
===== Sparkplug Edge Node

In the context of this specification, a Sparkplug Edge Node is any v3.1.1 or v5.0 compliant MQTT
Client application that manages an MQTT Session and provides the physical and/or logical gateway
functions required to participate in the Topic Namespace and Payload definitions described in
this document. The Edge Node is responsible for any local protocol interface to existing devices
(PLCs, RTUs, Flow Computers, Sensors, etc.) and/or any local discrete I/O, and/or any logical
internal process variables (PVs).

[[introduction_sparkplug_device]]
===== Sparkplug Device

A Sparkplug Device represents a physical or logical device that makes sense in the context of a
distributed Sparkplug application. Often times a Sparkplug Device will be a physical PLC, RTU, Flow
Computer, Sensor, etc. However, a Sparkplug device could also represent a logical grouping of data
points as makes sense for the specific Sparkplug Application being developed. For example, it could
represent a set of data points across multiple PLCs that make up a logical device that makes sense
within the context of that application.

[[introduction_mqtt_sparkplug_enabled_device]]
===== MQTT/Sparkplug Enabled Device

This represents any device, sensor, or hardware that directly connects to MQTT infrastructure using
a compliant MQTT v3.1.1 or v5.0 connection with the payload and topic notation as outlined in this
Sparkplug Specification. With MQTT/Sparkplug enabled directly in the device this could bypass the
use of a Sparkplug Device in the infrastructure. In this case, the physical device or sensor is
the Edge Node. It is up to the developer of the application to decide if the concept of a 'Sparkplug
Device' is to be used within their application.

[[introduction_host_applications]]
===== Host Applications

A Host Application is defined as an application that consumes data from Sparkplug Edge Nodes.
Depending on the nature of the Host Application it may consume Edge Node data and display it in a
dashboard, it may historize the data in a database, or it may analyze the data in some way.
SCADA/IIoT Hosts, MES, Historians, and Analytics applications are all examples of potential
Sparkplug Host Applications. A Host Application may perform many different functions in handling the
data. In addition, it may also send Sparkplug NCMD or DCMD messages to Edge Nodes.

There are two different types of Host Applications in Sparkplug. These are 'Primary' and 'Secondary'
Host Applications. In typical SCADA/IIoT infrastructure implementations, there will be only one
Primary Host Application responsible for the monitoring and control of a given group of Sparkplug
Edge Nodes. Within a Sparkplug system there can only be one Primary Host Application. Sparkplug does
not support the notion of multiple Primary Host Applications. This does not preclude any number of
Secondary Host Applications participating in the infrastructure that are in either a pure monitoring
mode, or in the role of a hot standby should the Primary Host Application go offline or become
unavailable within the infrastructure.

[[introduction_primary_host_application]]
===== Primary Host Application

Primary Host Applications differ from Secondary Host Applications in that they publish a 'STATE'
message which tells Edge Nodes within the infrastructure the session state of the Primary Host. This
allows Edge Nodes to make decisions based on whether or not the Primary Host Application is online
or not. For example, an Edge Node may store data at the edge until a Primary Host Application comes
back online. When the Primary Host Application publishes a new STATE message denoting it is online,
the Edge Node can resume publishing data and also flush any historical data that it may have stored
while offline.

In a traditional SCADA system the SCADA Host would be the Primary Host Application. It is the most
important consumer of data to keep operations running. With this same concept in mind, there can
only be one Primary Host Application as a result.

[[introduction_secondary_host_application]]
===== Secondary Host Application

A Secondary Host Application may be very similar to any Primary Host Application. Functionally,
there is only one difference between Primary and Secondary Host Applications.
[tck-testable tck-id-intro-secondary-host-state]#[yellow-background]*Secondary Host Applications
MUST NOT publish STATE messages denoting their online and offline status.*#
However, they can exist in a monitoring mode to consume the data in the same way that any Primary
Host Application would.

In addition if allowed by the Sparkplug Application and use-case, Secondary Host Applications MAY
publish NCMD and DCMD messages. Whether or not this is permitted is defined by the designers of the
overall Sparkplug enabled system.

[[introduction_sparkplug_ids]]
===== Sparkplug Identifiers

Sparkplug defines identifiers or IDs for different physical or logical components within the
infrastructure. There are three primary IDs and one that is a composite ID. These are defined as
the following.

* Group ID
** [tck-testable tck-id-intro-group-id-string]#[yellow-background]*The Group ID MUST be UTF-8 string
and used as part of the Sparkplug topics as defined in the link:#topics[Topics Section].*#
** [tck-testable tck-id-intro-group-id-chars]#[yellow-background]*Because the Group ID is used in
MQTT topic strings the Group ID MUST only contain characters allowed for MQTT topics per the MQTT
Specification.*#
** Non-normative comment: The Group ID represents a general grouping of Edge Nodes that makes sense
within the context of the Sparkplug application and use-case.
* Edge Node ID
** [tck-testable tck-id-intro-edge-node-id-string]#[yellow-background]*The Edge Node ID MUST be
UTF-8 string and used as part of the Sparkplug topics as defined in the
link:#topics[Topics Section].*#
** [tck-testable tck-id-intro-edge-node-id-chars]#[yellow-background]*Because the Edge Node ID is
used in MQTT topic strings the Group ID MUST only contain characters allowed for MQTT topics per the
MQTT Specification.*#
** Non-normative comment: The Edge Node ID represents a unique identifier for an Edge Node within
the context of the Group ID under which it exists.
* Device ID
** [tck-testable tck-id-intro-device-id-string]#[yellow-background]*The Device ID MUST be UTF-8
string and used as part of the Sparkplug topics as defined in the link:#topics[Topics Section].*#
** [tck-testable tck-id-intro-device-id-chars]#[yellow-background]*Because the Device ID is used in
MQTT topic strings the Group ID MUST only contain characters allowed for MQTT topics per the MQTT
Specification.*#
** Non-normative comment: The Device ID represents a unique identifier for a Device within the
context of the Edge Node ID under which it exists.
* Edge Node Descriptor (composite ID)
** The Edge Node Descriptor is the combination of the Group ID and Edge Node ID.
** [tck-testable tck-id-intro-device-id-string]#[yellow-background]*The Edge Node Descriptor MUST be
unique within the context of all of other Edge Nodes within the Sparkplug infrastructure.*# In other
words, no two Edge Nodes within a Sparkplug environment can have the same Group ID and same Edge
Node ID.
** Non-normative comment: The Device ID represents a unique identifier for a Device within the
context of the Edge Node ID under which it exists.

[[introduction_normative_references]]
=== Normative References

A list of all normative statements made in the Sparkplug specification document can be found in
link:#appendix_b[Appendix B].

[[introduction_security]]
=== Security
// TODO: Github #73

[[introduction_authentication]]
==== Authentication

There are several levels of security and access control configured within an MQTT infrastructure.
From a pure MQTT client perspective, the client must provide a unique MQTT Client ID, and an
optional MQTT username and password.

[[introduction_autorization]]
==== Authorization

Although access control is not mandated in the MQTT Specification for use in MQTT Server
implementations, Access Control List (ACL) functionality is available in many MQTT Server
implementations. The ACL of an MQTT Server implementation is used to specify which Topic Namespace
any MQTT Client can subscribe to and publish on. For example, it may make sense to have an Edge
Node's MQTT client only able to publish on topics associated with it's Group and Edge Node ID. This
would make it difficult for an MQTT client to spoof another Edge Node whether it be malicious or a
configuration setup error.

[[introduction_encryption]]
==== Encryption

The MQTT Specification does not specify any TCP/IP security scheme as it was envisaged during
development of the MQTT Specification that TCP/IP security would (and did) change over time.
Although this document will not specify any TCP/IP security schema it will provide examples on how
to secure an MQTT infrastructure using TLS security.

[[introduction_editing_convention]]
=== Editing Convention

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
"RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
2119. RFC 2119: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119

All normative statements in this document are highlighted in [yellow-background]*yellow text as

[[introduction_leveragint_standards_and_open_source]]
=== Leveraging Standards and Open Source

In addition to leveraging MQTT v3.1.1 and MQTT v5.0 standards, the Sparkplug Specification leverages
as much open source development tooling and data encoding as possible. Many different open source
organizations, projects, and ideas were used in the development of the Sparkplug Specification. More
information on these can be found in link:#appendix_a[Appendix A]
