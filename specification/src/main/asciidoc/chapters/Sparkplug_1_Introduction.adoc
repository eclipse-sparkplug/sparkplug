[[introduction]]
== Introduction

[[introduction_rationale_and_use_case]]
=== Rationale and Use Case

Eclipse Sparkplug provides an open and freely available specification for how Edge of Network
Gateways (Sparkplug Edge Nodes) or native MQTT enabled end devices and Sparkplug Host Applications
communicate bi-directionally within an MQTT Infrastructure. This document details the structure and
implementation requirements for Sparkplug compliant MQTT Client implementations on both Edge Nodes
and Host Applications.

It is recognized that MQTT is used across a wide spectrum of application solution use-cases, and an
almost indefinable variation of network topologies. To that end the Sparkplug Specification strives
to accomplish the three following goals.

[[introduction_define_an_mqtt_topic_namespace]]
==== Define an MQTT Topic Namespace

As noted many times in this document one of the many attractive features of MQTT is that it does not
specify any required MQTT Topic Namespace within its implementation. This fact has meant that MQTT
has taken a dominant position across a wide spectrum of IoT solutions. The intent of the Sparkplug
Specification is to identify and document a Topic Namespace that is well thought out and optimized
for the SCADA/IIoT solution sector. In addition, Sparkplug defines a Topic Namespace in such a way
that it provides semantics which allow for automatic discovery and bi-directional communication
between MQTT clients in a system.

[[introduction_define_mqtt_state_management]]
==== Define MQTT State Management

One of the unique aspects of MQTT is that it was originally designed for real time SCADA systems to
help reduce data latency over bandwidth limited and outage prone network infrastructures. These can
include cellular, satellite, and other radio based networks. In many implementations the full
benefit of this “Continuous Session Awareness” is not well understood, or not even implemented. The
intent of the Sparkplug Specification is to take full advantage of MQTT’s native Continuous Session
Awareness capability as it applies to real time SCADA/IIoT solutions.

It is important to note that reducing bandwidth usage and being resilient to network drops is
advantageous on more reliable and high bandwidth networks as well. By reducing the bandwidth usage,
Sparkplug is able to move more data through the network because of its efficiency. This in turn can
reduce network costs.

[[introduction_define_the_mqtt_payload]]
==== Define the MQTT Payload

Just as the MQTT Specification does not dictate any particular Topic Namespace, it also does not
dictate any particular payload data encoding. The intent of the Sparkplug Specification is to define
payload encoding mechanisms that remain true to the original, lightweight, bandwidth efficient, low
latency features of MQTT while adding modern encoding schemes targeting the SCADA/IIoT solution
space.

Sparkplug has defined an approach where the Topic Namespace can aid in the determination of the
encoding scheme of any particular payload. Historically there have been two Sparkplug defined
encoding schemes. The first one was the 'Sparkplug A' and the second is 'Sparkplug B'. Each of
these uses a 'first topic token identifier' so Sparkplug Edge Nodes can declare the payload encoding
scheme they are using. These first topic tokens are:

----
spAv1.0
spBv1.0
----

Each token is divided up into three distinct components. These are:

* Sparkplug Identifier
** Always 'sp'
* Payload Encoding Scheme
** Currently 'A' or 'B' but there could be future versions
* Payload Encoding Scheme Version
** Currently v1.0 but denoted in the event that future versions are released

The original 'Sparkplug A' encoding scheme was based on the Eclipse Kura™ open source Google
Protocol Buffer definition. 'Sparkplug B' was released shortly after the release of Sparkplug A and
addressed a number of issues that were present in the A version of the payload encoding scheme. Due
to lack of adoption and the fact that 'Sparkplug B' was made available shortly after the release of
'A', the Sparkplug A definition has been omitted from this document and is no longer supported.

The 'Sparkplug B' encoding scheme was created with a richer data model developed with the feedback
of many system integrators and end user customers using MQTT. These additions included metric
timestamp support, complex datatype support, metadata, and other improvements.

[[introduction_background]]
==== Background

MQTT was originally designed as a message transport for real-time SCADA systems. The MQTT
Specification does not specify the Topic Namespace nor does it define the Payload representation
of the data being published and/or subscribed to. In addition to this, since the original use-case
for MQTT was targeting real-time SCADA, there are mechanisms defined to provide the state of an
MQTT session such that SCADA/Control Human-Machine Interface (HMI) application can monitor the
current state of any MQTT enabled device in the infrastructure. As with the Topic Namespace and
Payload the way state information is implemented and managed within the MQTT infrastructure is not
defined. All of this was intentional within the original MQTT Specification to provide maximum
flexibility across any solution sector that might choose to use MQTT infrastructures.

But at some point, for MQTT based solutions to be interoperable within a given market sector, the
Topic Namespace, Payload representation, and session state must be defined. The intent and purpose
of the Sparkplug Specification is to define an MQTT Topic Namespace, payload, and session state
management that can be applied generically to the overall IIoT market sector, but specifically meets
the requirements of real-time SCADA/Control HMI solutions. Meeting the operational requirements for
these systems will enable MQTT based infrastructures to provide more valuable real-time information
to Line of Business and MES solution requirements as well.

The purpose of the Sparkplug Specification is to remain true to the original notion of keeping the
Topic Namespace and message sizes to a minimum while still making the overall message transactions
and session state management between MQTT enabled devices and MQTT SCADA/IIoT applications simple,
efficient, easy to understand, and implement.

[[introduction_infrastructure_components]]
==== Infrastructure Components

This section details the infrastructure components implemented.

.Figure 1 - MQTT SCADA Infrastructure
plantuml::{assetsdir}assets/plantuml/infrastructure-components.puml[format=svg, alt="MQTT Scada Infrastructure"]


[[introduction_mqtt_servers]]
===== MQTT Server(s)

Program or device that acts as an intermediary between Clients which publish Application Messages 
and Clients which have made Subscriptions[MQTTV5-1.2]. MQTT enabled infrastructure requires that one 
or more MQTT Servers are present in the infrastructure. An MQTT Server must be compatible with the 
requirements outlined in the link:#conformance[Conformance Section]. In addition, it must be sized 
to properly manage all MQTT message traffic.

One can implement the use (if required) of multiple MQTT servers for redundancy, high availability,
and scalability within any given infrastructure.

[[introduction_sparkplug_group]]
===== Sparkplug Group

Logical or physical group of Edge Nodes that makes sense in the context of
a distributed Sparkplug application. Groups can represent physical groups of Edge Nodes. For
example, a Sparkplug Group could represent a set of Edge Nodes at a particular location, facility,
or along a specific oil pipeline. Alternatively, a Sparkplug Group could represent group of similar
types of Edge Nodes. For example, it could represent a particular set of like make and models of
embedded gateways. The groups are meant to be defined by the system architects as appropriate for
their particular application.

[[introduction_sparkplug_edge_node]]
===== Sparkplug Edge Node

Any v3.1.1 or v5.0 compliant MQTT Client application that manages an MQTT Session and provides the 
physical and/or logical gateway functions required to participate in the Topic Namespace and Payload 
definitions described in this document. The Edge Node is responsible for any local protocol 
interface to existing devices (PLCs, RTUs, Flow Computers, Sensors, etc.) and/or any local discrete 
I/O, and/or any logical internal process variables (PVs).

[[introduction_sparkplug_device]]
===== Sparkplug Device

Physical or logical device that makes sense in the context of a distributed Sparkplug application. 
Often times a Sparkplug Device will be a physical PLC, RTU, Flow Computer, Sensor, etc. However, a 
Sparkplug device could also represent a logical grouping of data  points as makes sense for the 
specific Sparkplug Application being developed. For example, it could represent a set of data points 
across multiple PLCs that make up a logical device that makes sense within the context of that 
application.

[[introduction_mqtt_sparkplug_enabled_device]]
===== MQTT/Sparkplug Enabled Device

Any device, sensor, or hardware that directly connects to MQTT infrastructure using
a compliant MQTT v3.1.1 or v5.0 connection with the payload and topic notation as outlined in this
Sparkplug Specification. With MQTT/Sparkplug enabled directly in the device this could bypass the
use of a Sparkplug Edge Node in the infrastructure. In this case, the physical device or sensor is
the Edge Node. It is up to the developer of the application to decide if the concept of a 'Sparkplug
Device' is to be used within their application.

[[introduction_host_applications]]
===== Host Applications

Application that consumes data from Sparkplug Edge Nodes. Depending on the nature of the Host 
Application it may consume Edge Node data and display it in a dashboard, it may historize the data 
in a database, or it may analyze the data in some way. SCADA/IIoT Hosts, MES, Historians, and 
Analytics applications are all examples of potential Sparkplug Host Applications. A Host Application 
may perform many different functions in handling the data. In addition, Host Applications may also 
send Sparkplug REBIRTH, NCMD, or DCMD messages to Edge Nodes.

A Sparkplug Edge Node may specify one Host Application as its 'Primary Host Application'. This is
handled by the Edge Node waiting to publish its NBIRTH and DBIRTH messages until the Host
Application that the Edge Node has designated as its Primary Host application has come online.
Sparkplug does not support the notion of multiple Primary Host Applications. This does not preclude
any number of additional Host Applications participating in the infrastructure that are in either a
pure monitoring mode, or in the role of a hot standby should the Edge Node's Primary Host
Application go offline or become unavailable within the infrastructure.

[tck-testable tck-id-intro-sparkplug-host-state]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-intro-sparkplug-host-state] Sparkplug
Host Applications MUST publish STATE messages denoting their online and offline status.*#

[[introduction_primary_host_application]]
===== Primary Host Application
Most important consumer of Sparkplug Edge Node data. The Primary Host Application must be online 
to keep operations running.

A Primary Host Application may be defined by an Edge Node. The Edge Node's behavior may change
based on the status of its configured Primary Host. It is not required that an Edge Node must have
a Primary Host configured but it may be useful in certain applications. This allows Edge Nodes to
make decisions based on whether or not the Primary Host Application is online or not. For example,
an Edge Node may store data at the edge until a Primary Host Application comes back online. When the
Primary Host Application publishes a new STATE message denoting it is online, the Edge Node can
resume publishing data and also flush any historical data that it may have stored while offline.

In a traditional SCADA system the SCADA Host would be the Primary Host Application. With this same 
concept in mind, there can only be one Primary Host Application configured in an Edge Node as a 
result.

[[introduction_sparkplug_ids]]
===== Sparkplug Identifiers

Sparkplug defines identifiers or IDs for different physical or logical components within the
infrastructure. There are three primary IDs and one that is a composite ID. These are defined as
the following.

* Group ID
** [tck-testable tck-id-intro-group-id-string]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-intro-group-id-string]
The Group ID MUST be a UTF-8 string and used as part of the Sparkplug topics as defined in the
link:#topics[Topics Section].*#
** [tck-testable tck-id-intro-group-id-chars]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-intro-group-id-chars]
Because the Group ID is used in MQTT topic strings the Group ID MUST only contain characters allowed
for MQTT topics per the MQTT Specification.*#
*** Non-normative comment: The Group ID represents a general grouping of Edge Nodes that makes sense
within the context of the Sparkplug application and use-case.
* Edge Node ID
** [tck-testable tck-id-intro-edge-node-id-string]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-intro-edge-node-id-string]
The Edge Node ID MUST be a  UTF-8 string and used as part of the Sparkplug topics as defined in the
link:#topics[Topics Section].*#
** [tck-testable tck-id-intro-edge-node-id-chars]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-intro-edge-node-id-chars]
Because the Edge Node ID is used in MQTT topic strings the Edge Node ID MUST only contain characters
allowed for MQTT topics per the MQTT Specification.*#
*** Non-normative comment: The Edge Node ID represents a unique identifier for an Edge Node within
the context of the Group ID under which it exists.
* Device ID
** [tck-testable tck-id-intro-device-id-string]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-intro-device-id-string]
The Device ID MUST be a UTF-8 string and used as part of the Sparkplug topics as defined in the
link:#topics[Topics Section].*#
** [tck-testable tck-id-intro-device-id-chars]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-intro-device-id-chars]
Because the Device ID is used in MQTT topic strings the Device ID MUST only contain characters
allowed for MQTT topics per the MQTT Specification.*#
*** Non-normative comment: The Device ID represents a unique identifier for a Device within the
context of the Edge Node ID under which it exists.
* Edge Node Descriptor (composite ID)
** The Edge Node Descriptor is the combination of the Group ID and Edge Node ID.
** [tck-testable tck-id-intro-edge-node-id-uniqueness]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-intro-edge-node-id-uniqueness]
The Edge Node Descriptor MUST be unique within the context of all of other Edge Nodes within the
Sparkplug infrastructure.*#
*** In other words, no two Edge Nodes within a Sparkplug environment can have the same Group ID and
same Edge Node ID.
*** Non-normative comment: The Device ID represents a unique identifier for a Device within the
context of the Edge Node ID under which it exists.

[[introduction_sparkplug_metrics]]
===== Sparkplug Metric

Identifies a single 'tag change event' in the Sparkplug Payload. It represents an event that 
occurred at the Edge Node or Device such as a value or quality of a data point changing. For 
example, it could represent the value of an analog or boolean changing at a Sparkplug Device. A 
Sparkplug Metric typically includes a name, value, and timestamp. Sparkplug Metrics are also used in 
NCMD and DCMD messages to send messages to Edge Nodes and Devices to change values at the Edge.

[[introduction_datatypes]]
===== Data Types

There are different uses of the term 'datatype' in the specification. Sparkplug encodes the
payloads using Google Protocol Buffers. Google Protocol Buffers has its own scalar value types here:
https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar

The Google Protocol Buffer datatypes define what actually travels over the TCP/IP socket in the MQTT
payload. For ease of programming, Google Protobuf includes a compiler tool that generates code in
multiple different languages. These Protobuf datatypes are then represented by their proper native
programming language datatypes. This is done on a per language basis after the Google Protobuf file
is used to generate the code for each specific language.

In addition to Protobuf datatypes and native programming language datatypes there are also
'Sparkplug datatypes'. These are defined in the
link:#payloads_b_google_protocol_buffer_schema[Sparkplug Protobuf Schema]. These datatypes are those
that are used for Sparkplug Metrics. Every Metric must include a Sparkplug Datatype in the NBIRTH or
DBIRTH message depending on whether the Metric is a 'Node level' or 'Device level' metric. Each of
the Sparkplug Datatypes is then represented by a Google Protobuf datatype.

[[introduction_list_normative_statements]]
=== Consolidated List of Normative Statements

A list of all normative statements made in the Sparkplug specification document can be found in
link:#appendix_b[Appendix B].

[[introduction_security]]
=== Security

Security is not directly addressed in the Sparkplug Specification with normative statements.
However, security should be addressed appropriately in every Sparkplug system. MQTT clients,
servers, authentication, authorization, network access, physical access, and all other aspects of
security should be addressed based on how the system will be deployed and used. Because Sparkplug
utilizes MQTT and TCP/IP, the security features and best practices of those protocols also applies
to Sparkplug. The security practices related to TCP/IP and MQTT have changed throughout the years
and likely will continue to do so. As a result, the Sparkplug Specification will defer to the
underlying protocols and industry standards for best practices. However, some non-normative
statements are included with regard to security in the Sparkplug Specification.

[[introduction_authentication]]
==== Authentication

There are several levels of security and access control configured within an MQTT infrastructure.
From a pure MQTT client perspective, the client must provide a unique MQTT Client ID, and an
optional MQTT username and password.

[[introduction_autorization]]
==== Authorization

Although access control is not mandated in the MQTT Specification for use in MQTT Server
implementations, Access Control List (ACL) functionality is available in many MQTT Server
implementations. The ACL of an MQTT Server implementation is used to specify which Topic Namespace
any MQTT Client can subscribe to and publish on. For example, it may make sense to have an Edge
Node's MQTT client only able to publish on topics associated with it's Group and Edge Node ID. This
would make it difficult for an MQTT client to spoof another Edge Node whether it be malicious or a
configuration setup error.

[[introduction_encryption]]
==== Encryption

The MQTT Specification does not specify any TCP/IP security scheme as it was envisaged during
development of the MQTT Specification that TCP/IP security would (and did) change over time.
Although this document will not specify any TCP/IP security schema it will provide examples on how
to secure an MQTT infrastructure using TLS security.

[[introduction_editing_convention]]
=== Normative Keywords

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
"RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
[BCP14].

All normative statements in this document are highlighted in [yellow-background]*yellow text as
shown here*.

[[introduction_leveragint_standards_and_open_source]]
=== Leveraging Standards and Open Source

In addition to leveraging MQTT v3.1.1 [MQTTV311] and MQTT v5.0 [MQTTV50] standards, the Sparkplug
Specification leverages as much open source development tooling and data encoding as possible. Many
different open source organizations, projects, and ideas were used in the development of the
Sparkplug Specification. More information on these can be found in link:#appendix_a[Appendix A]
