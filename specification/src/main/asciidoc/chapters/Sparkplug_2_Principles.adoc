This section discusses the generic topology shown in Figure 3 – Simple MQTT Infrastructure identifying how 
each of the components of the infrastructure interacts.

At the simplest level, there are only two components required as shown below. An MQTT Client and an MQTT 
Server. With proper credentials, any MQTT Client can connect to the MQTT Server without any notion of other 
MQTT Client applications that are connected, and can issue subscriptions to any MQTT messages that it might 
be interested in as well as start publishing any message containing data that it has. This is one of the 
principal notions of IIoT, that is the decoupling of intelligent devices from any direct connection to any 
one consumer application.

[[principles_continuous_session_awareness]]
=== Continuous Session Awareness

In any network architecture, network connection *_State_* is important. In SCADA/IIoT, connection *_State_* 
is extremely important. *State* is the session awareness of the MQTT EoN and the MQTT Server. The very reason 
that most SCADA Host systems in this market sector are still using legacy poll/response protocols to 
maintain a notion of the *_State_* of the connection between the SCADA application and the connected 
devices. “_I poll, I get a response, I know the *State* of all the I/O points, but now I must poll again 
because that *State* may have changed.”_

Many implementations of solutions using MQTT treat it as a simple, stateless, pub/sub state machine. This is 
quite viable for IoT and some IIoT applications, however it is not taking advantage of the full capability 
of MQTT based infrastructures.

One of the primary applications for MQTT as it was originally designed was to provide reliable SCADA 
communications over VSAT topologies. Due to propagation delay and cost, it was not feasible to use a 
poll/response protocol. Instead of a poll/response protocol where all the data was sent in response to every 
poll, MQTT was used to “publish” information from remote sites only when the data changed. This technique is 
sometimes called Report by Exception or RBE. But for RBE to work properly in real-time SCADA, the “state” of 
the end device needs to be always known. In other words, SCADA/IIoT host could only rely on RBE data 
arriving reliably if it could be assured of the state of the MQTT session.

The Sparkplug™ specification defines the use of the MQTT V3.1.1 “Last Will and Testament” feature to provide 
MQTT session state information to any other interested MQTT client in the infrastructure. The session state 
awareness is implemented around a set of defined “Birth” and “Death” Topic Namespace and Payload definitions 
in conjunction with the MQTT connection “Keep Alive” timer.

[[principles_persistent_connections]]
=== Persistent Connections

Persistent connections are intended to remain connected to the MQTT infrastructure at all times. They never 
send an MQTT DISCONNECT message during normal operation. This fact lets the _Primary Application_ provide the 
real-time state of every persistent node in the infrastructure within the configured MQTT Keep Alive period 
using the Birth/Death mechanisms defined above.

But in some use cases, such as sending GPS coordinates for asset tracking or other IOT applications with 
periodic data from sensors, MQTT enabled devices do not need to remain connected to the MQTT infrastructure. 
In these use cases, all the Device needs to do is to issue an MQTT DISCONNECT control packet prior to going 
offline to leave the MQTT infrastructure “gracefully”. In this case an MQTT Device or associated Device DEATH 
certificate will most normally not be seen. System designers just need to be aware that the metric in 
_Primary Application_ in this case will represent “Last Known Good” values with a time stamp of this data 
where the current state of the of the MQTT Device is not a real-time indication. The _Primary Application_ 
metric time stamp values can be used to determine when the values from this node were last updated.

Non-persistent MQTT Enabled Devices should still register a proper DEATH Certificate upon the establishment 
of an MQTT session. In this manner, the _Primary Application_ can still have a good representation of Last 
Known Good process variable versus the fact that the MQTT session was terminated prior to the EoN node being 
able to complete its transaction.
