=== Pub/Sub

This section discusses the simple topology shown in "Figure 2 – Simple MQTT Infrastructure"
identifying how each of the components of the infrastructure interacts.

At the simplest level, there are only two components required as shown below. An MQTT client and an
MQTT server are the primary two components. With proper credentials, any MQTT client can connect to
the MQTT server without any notion of other MQTT client applications that are connected. The client
can issue subscriptions to any MQTT messages that it might be interested in as well as start
publishing any message containing data that it has. This is one of the principal notions of IIoT,
that is the decoupling of devices from any direct connection to any one consumer
application.

[[principles_report_by_exception]]
=== Report by Exception

The Sparkplug Specification uses the concept of Report by Exception (RBE). Because Sparkplug
utilizes the built in functions of MQTT to maintain session awareness, messages only need to be sent
by an Edge Node when values at the edge change. In the initial BIRTH messages, all of the current
metric values are published in the payload. Because the MQTT session is stateful [MQTTV5-4.1], after
the initial BIRTH messages are sent, new metric values only need to be published when the values
change.

Sparkplug does not require that RBE be used in all cases. This is to account for special
circumstances that may require periodic reporting. However, as a general rule periodic publishing
should not be used.

[tck-testable tck-id-principles-rbe-recommended]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-principles-rbe-recommended] Because
of the stateful nature of Sparkplug sessions, data SHOULD NOT be published from Edge Nodes on a
periodic basis and instead SHOULD be published using a RBE based approach.*#

[[principles_continuous_session_awareness]]
=== Continuous Session Awareness

In any network architecture, network connection "State" is important. In SCADA/IIoT, connection
State is extremely important. State is the session awareness of the MQTT Edge Node and the MQTT
Server. Note the uses of the term 'session' here should not be confused with MQTT's 'clean session'
concept/flags. That is covered later in this specification. The very reason that most SCADA Host
systems in this market sector are still using legacy poll/response protocols to maintain a notion of
the State of the connection between the SCADA application and the connected devices. “_I poll, I get
a response, I know the State of all the I/O points, but now I must poll again because that State may
have changed._”

Many implementations of solutions using MQTT treat it as a simple, stateless, pub/sub state machine.
This is quite viable for IoT and some IIoT applications, however it is not taking advantage of the
full capability of MQTT based infrastructures.

One of the primary applications for MQTT as it was originally designed was to provide reliable SCADA 
communications over VSAT networks. Due to propagation delay and cost, it was not feasible to use a 
poll/response protocol. Instead of a poll/response protocol where all the data was sent in response
to every poll, MQTT was used to publish information from remote sites only when the data changed.
This technique is sometimes called Report by Exception or RBE. But for RBE to work properly in
real-time SCADA, the “state” of the end device needs to be always known. In other words, SCADA/IIoT
host could only rely on RBE data arriving reliably if it could be assured of the state of the MQTT
session.

The Eclipse Sparkplug specification defines the use of the MQTT “Will Message” feature
[MQTTV5-3.1.2.5] to provide MQTT session state information to any other interested MQTT client in
the infrastructure. The session state awareness is implemented around a set of defined BIRTH and
DEATH topic namespace and payload definitions in conjunction with the MQTT connection “Keep Alive”
timer.

[[principles_birth_and_death_certificates]]
=== Birth and Death Certificates

Birth and Death Certificates are used by both Edge Nodes and Host Applications. Death Certificates
for both are always registered in the MQTT CONNECT packet as the MQTT Will Message. By using the
MQTT Will message, the Death Certificates will be delivered to subscribers even if the MQTT client
connection is lost ungracefully. For Edge Nodes, the Death Certificate uses the NDEATH Sparkplug
verb in the topic. For Host Applications, the spBv1.0/STATE/sparkplug_host_id topic is used. More
information on Death certificates can be found in
link:#payloads_b_ndeath[Edge Node Death Certificates] and
link:#payloads_b_state[Host Application Death Certificates]

* [tck-testable tck-id-principles-birth-certificates-order]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-principles-birth-certificates-order]
Birth Certificates MUST be the first MQTT messages published by any Edge Node or any Host
Application.*#

Birth Certificates denote to any subscribing MQTT clients that the Edge Node or Host Application is
now online. For Edge Nodes, the Birth Certificate uses the NBIRTH Sparkplug verb in the topic. For
Host Applications, the spBv1.0/STATE/sparkplug_host_id topic is used. More details and requirements
on Birth certificates can be found in
link:#payloads_b_nbirth[Edge Node Birth Certificates] and
link:#payloads_b_state[Host Application Birth Certificates]

[[principles_persistent_vs_non_persistent_connections]]
=== Persistent vs Non-Persistent Connections for Edge Nodes

Persistent connections are intended to remain connected to the MQTT infrastructure at all times.
They never send an MQTT DISCONNECT control packet [MQTTV5-3.14] during normal operation. This fact lets the
Host Applications provide the real-time state of every persistent node in the infrastructure within
the configured MQTT Keep Alive period using the BIRTH/DEATH mechanisms defined above.

But in some use cases, such as sending GPS coordinates for asset tracking or other IOT applications
with periodic data from sensors, MQTT enabled devices do not need to remain connected to the MQTT
infrastructure. In these use cases, all the Device needs to do is to issue an MQTT DISCONNECT
control packet prior to going offline to leave the MQTT infrastructure “gracefully”. In this case an
MQTT device or associated DEATH certificate will not be sent to Sparkplug Host Applications. System
designers just need to be aware that the metric in the Host Application will represent “Last Known
Good” values with a timestamp of this data where the current state of the MQTT Device is not
a real-time indication. The Host Application metric timestamp values can be used to determine when
the values from this Edge Node were last updated.

Non-persistent MQTT Enabled Devices should still register a proper DEATH Certificate upon the
establishment of an MQTT session. In this manner, the Host Application can still have a good
representation of last known good process variable versus the fact that the MQTT session was
terminated prior to the Edge Node being able to complete its transaction.

Regardless of a persistent or non-persistent connection, the following rules must be followed:

* [tck-testable tck-id-principles-persistence-clean-session-311]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-principles-persistence-clean-session-311]
If the MQTT client is using MQTT v3.1.1, the Edge Node's MQTT CONNECT packet MUST set the 'Clean
Session' flag to true.*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-principles-persistence-clean-session-50]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-principles-persistence-clean-session-50]
If the MQTT client is using MQTT v5.0, the Edge Node's MQTT CONNECT packet MUST set the 'Clean
Start' flag to true and the 'Session Expiry Interval' to 0.*#
