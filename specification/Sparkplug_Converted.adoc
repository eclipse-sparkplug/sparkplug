== Sparkplug™ MQTT Data and Command Messages

Looking back in this document we’ve described the following components:

* Primary Application
* MQTT Server(s)
* Edge of Network (EoN) nodes
* Devices
* Topic Namespace
* Birth Certificates
* Death Certificates
* STATE Messages
* Primary Application, EoN node, and Device Session Establishment

All of these specifications and definitions get to the primary goal of Sparkplug™, that is to deliver a rich set of real time device metric data extremely efficiently to many data consumers within the Enterprise while still providing a best in class Command/Control SCADA/IIoT system.

The disruptive notion of the emerging IIoT mindset is that intelligent devices should be smart enough to deliver metric information to the infrastructure when it is required. But the fact of the matter is that the existing population of 100’s of millions of the smart devices need to be “asked” if something has changed using poll/response protocols. This is why we’re seeing the emergence of edge devices throughout the industrial sector. For the decade or more that it will take for device manufactures to embed IIoT technology natively, the solution being employed today is to place this capability in small embedded devices closer to the data producers themselves. So within the Sparkplug™ specification these devices called Edge of Network Nodes (EoN) represent this new class of Gateway, Edge Controller, Edge of Network Node, Protocol Gateway, and many more acronyms for the same class of devices. The capabilities of these devices are in an extreme range of low power microcontrollers to multicore Intel and ARM based processors. The operating systems range from full embedded Linux kernels and Windows embedded to small bare metal RTOS’s. Regardless of the category these gateway devices fall into the simplicity of MQTT and the Sparkplug™ specification should be applicable across the board.

This section of the Sparkplug™ specification goes into detail on how metrics are published/subscribed to within an MQTT infrastructure in real time and the resulting metric information that the _Primary Application_ can read/write to.
